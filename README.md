I decide on August 1st, 2018 that I needed a structured approach to improve my existing coding skills.

I came to this realization after a number of interview failures. To my knowledge I did well in all of
those interviews considering it was in SQL which I thought I was good at if not great but i didn't 
receive a call back even after I considered that I aced those tests.

So i have decided to actively improved my coding skills in SQL and Python for now.
